On the second of January 2020 I got a completely standard Opel Vivaro with no insulation, no nothing, just a typical work van.

I have a few plans that I outline in the following video:

If you don't feel like watching, here they are in text form:

Must-haves(by order of importance):

- Insulation
- Bed(200x90cm) with foam mattress
- Leisure battery
- Heating
- On-board computer for navigation and with a rear facing wideangle lens webcam(this is my first car ever and it's 5.3 metres long, so I need the help to park sometimes, doubles as a security camera)
- Space for a bike inside the van
- Micro kitchen

Nice-to-haves:

- Passenger swivel seat with computer table

I plan to do this as cheap as possible and build it in a way that I can take it apart in less than an hour or so for the days I need the space to haul stuff.
