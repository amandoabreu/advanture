There's a possibility that with decent isolation I can already spend a few nights in the van before my heater arrives, so today I went to see what I could find.

The initial plan was polystyrene boards, but, for some reason, a 50x80cm board cost over 600kr/60€! I have no idea why that was the case, but rock wool was 235kr/24€ for 6.1 square metres of 50mm thick material. Each side of the van is about 4 square metres, and the top is 3.5 or so. I got 12 square metres of rock wool, and 4x 6x1220x2440mm wooden boards.

The idea is to put the rock wool between the wood and the van's walls. I will not use a vapour barrier, but I will check how it handles moisture after a couple of nights.

For the floor I already have a plastic/rubber mat, and on top of that I will put a carpet from Ikea. I think it will be enough.
