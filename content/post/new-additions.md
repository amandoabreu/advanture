Although I really wanted a double bed, it's just not possible with the space constraints.

There are a few must-haves for the bed:

- 200cm long
- Low enough that I can sit on it comfortably
- High enough to have basic storage under it
- Foam mattress

I found a good contender at Ikea.

The bed frame costs 399kr(39â‚¬) and measures 30x200x94cm with 20cm of space under it. It's very low, but I don't yet know if I can prop it up and have enough space to sit, I have to check later. I wouldn't mind a thinner bed, but couldn't find one for this price, plus, I might be able to remove some centimetres.

The mattress costs an extra 499kr/49â‚¬.

Unsure whether or not the mattress is required, but I have a feeling this will lead to much better nights than thin camping stuff.
