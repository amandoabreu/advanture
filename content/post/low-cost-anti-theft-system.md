Hey folks, given that some of us have valuables in our vehicles and often end up parked in strange/isolated places, it's likely that sooner or later someone ill-intended will come across our vehicles.

The video I'm about to show you to explains how to install a kill-switch that turns off your fuel pump, which makes your car impossible to start with the key, hot wiring, or even by push starting. It would have to be towed in order to be stolen.

It doesn't protect the valuables inside the car, but I'd personally rather lose a phone or a computer monitor than the entire vehicle!

The total cost of this is less than 10 dollars/euros and is completely reversible.
